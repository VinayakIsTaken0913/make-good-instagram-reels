<p>
1. Do not post random/effortless reels
</p>
<p>
Most reels are like this. People showing off their body, a woman showing her beauty. A person walking through the aisles of a mall. Well, there are just effortless and are boring to look at. People will switch to YouTube shorts or TikTok if this continues
</p>
<br>
<p>
2. Show something Cute
</p>
<p>
Can be an animal, a baby. Must be entertaining and be of interest.
</p>
<br>
<p>
3. EduInformative reels
</p>
<p>
Show proper art techniques. Inform people about cheap places and lifestyle. Teach math and English.
</p>
<br>
<p>
4.Good entertainment
</p>
<p>
A meme or joke recording that is made in reel style and makes sense. It should make watchers laugh.
</p>
<br>
<p>
5. The last seconds can be okay but the first seconds have to be good
</p>
<p>
The first 1 second has to show instant interest in the viewer (it makes the viewer decide whether to watch the reel or scroll down). The other starting seconds has to keep the viewer hooked. Keep the whole reel interesting.
</p>
<br>
<p>
6. Don’t make it inappropriate
</p>
<p>
Some kids might watch reels with their dad, so to prevent reports and eventually get your reel removed by Instagram, don’t add inappropriate content.
</p>
<br>
<p>
7.Make it like the liked reels
</p>
<p>
Research and record liked reels. Then think yourself if you made a reel like that will it get likes? Make a reel that is like the liked ones and would gain likes and followers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
8.Collect data from a variety instagram users and their friends
</p>
<p>
See what reels they like (including their friends) and make a reel based on the data.
